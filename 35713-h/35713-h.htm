<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span> has much pleasure in recommending the following
Prospectus to the notice of parents desirous of finding a thoroughly
practical school where boys are educated according to the real
requirements of modern life.</p>

<h4>CLOANTHUS HOUSE, MARKET DREPANUM, OXON.</h4>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">J. Pen-Rullox</span>, M.A. Cambs., and the Rev. <span class="sc">Wilfrid
Bails</span>, B.A. Oxon, receive
pupils to prepare for the
great public schools and
universities.</p>

<p>The well-known qualifications
of Mr. <span class="sc">Pen-Rullox</span>,
who rowed stroke in
his university boat in the
celebrated race at Amwell
in 1878, and of the Rev.
Mr. <span class="sc">Bails</span>, who played for
Oxford in the famous university
match in the Common
Fields in 1882, will be
sufficient guarantee that
the boys will be thoroughly
well instructed.</p>

<p>Besides Rowing, Cricket,
and Football; Swimming,
Racquets, Boxing, and
Hockey, are specially attended
to by competent
Assistant-Masters, under
the personal supervision of
the Principals.</p>

<p>Billiards, Lawn-tennis,
Poker, Nurr and Spell, and
some other minor games, now too frequently neglected in the education
of youth, will find their due place in the curriculum of Cloanthus
House.</p>

<p>It is in contemplation, should a sufficient number of boys show a
marked inclination for such studies, to engage a Board-school Master,
of approved competence, to direct literary and scientific work.</p>

<p>Terms, inclusive, £250 per annum, payable in advance: the only
extras at present being Reading, Writing, Polo, and Arithmetic.</p>

<p>Reference is kindly permitted to the following:&mdash;The Right Rev.
the Bishop of <span class="sc">Isthmia</span>; the Editor of the <i>Sporting Life</i>; the Rev.
<span class="sc">R. E. D. Horgan</span>, M.A., Jesurum Col., Cambs; the Sports Editor of
the <i>Field</i>; the Warden of Mortlake College, Putney; Dr. <span class="sc">S. A.
Grace</span>, LL.D.; the Hon. and Rev. <span class="sc">Hurlingham Peel</span>.</p>

<h3>THE BITTER CRY OF THE BROKEN-VOICED CHORISTER.</h3>

<h4>(<i>A long way after Tennyson.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Break, break, break,</p>
<p class="i2">O voice on that clear top C!</p>
<p>And I would that my throat could utter</p>
<p class="i2">High notes as they used to be.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>O well for old <span class="sc">Bundlecoop's</span> boy</p>

<p class="i2">That he sings in his old clear way.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And the anthems still go on</p>
<p class="i2">With boy-trebles sharp and shrill;</p>
<p>But O for <i>my</i> "compass," so high and grand,</p>
<p class="i2">And the voice that I <i>used</i> to trill!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Break, break, break,</p>
<p class="i2">Like a creaky old gate, top C!</p>
<p>But the high treble notes of a voice that is cracked,</p>
<p class="i2">Will never come back to me!</p>

<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">The White Currency Question.</span>&mdash;Can nothing be done to
prevent the Indian <span class="sc">Viceroy</span> from carrying out his monstrous proposal
about the Rupee? I was just off to Bombay (having recently
completed a period of enforced seclusion in Devonshire, occasioned
by a too successful competition with a monopolist Mint) on the
strength of a newspaper paragraph that "Free Coining of Silver"
was permitted in that happy land. Free Coining! In my opinion
it beats "Free Education" hollow, and is just what I have always
wanted. I felt that my fortune was made, when suddenly the news
comes that the free coinage business is stopped. What an injustice!
In the name of the down-trodden Hindoo, to whom my specially
manufactured nickel-and-tin Rupee would have been quite a new
revelation, I protest against this interference with the immemorial
customs of our Oriental fellow-subjects.&mdash;<span class="sc">Jeremiah D'Iddla.</span></p>

<h3>AT COVENT GARDEN LAST THURSDAY.</h3>

<p>Production of new Opera, <i>Amy Robsart</i>, arranged (and very
well arranged, too) from Sir <span class="sc">Walter Scott's</span> novel, by Sir <span class="sc">Augustus
Harris</span> and <span class="sc">Paul Milliet</span>, the English adaptation by <span class="sc">Frederic
Weatherly</span>, and music by <span class="sc">Isidore de Lara</span>. <span class="sc">Calvé</span> in the
title <i>rôle</i>, splendid; going through everything&mdash;three rather lengthy Acts,
two impassioned love-duets, and the trap-door in the bridge&mdash;with
unflagging spirit and charm.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/037-2-350.png"><img src="images/037-2-150.png" width="150" height="185" alt="Music by Isidore de Lara." /></a></div>

<p>In the Second Act, Kenilworth shown illuminated for the reception
of <i>Elizabeth</i>&mdash;<i>Leicester</i> having evidently borrowed one of the band
kiosks from Earl's Court. <i>Elizabeth</i>, according
to stage directions, should have entered
"seated upon a magnificent white horse,"
but preferred to walk in. Possibly her steed
detained by business engagements. As represented
by Madame <span class="sc">Armand</span>, an easy-going,
sunny-tempered sovereign, with an amiable
dislike of any "unpleasantness" among her
courtiers. The <i>Earl of Sussex</i> the most
impressive mute (next to his contemporary
the <i>Earl of Burleigh</i> in <i>The Critic</i>) on the
boards,&mdash;nothing to do but look haughty,
and at last, at the Queen's command, consent
to become reconciled to <i>Leicester</i>,&mdash;but the
subtle suggestion in his "shake-hands" that he did so on compulsion,
and reserved himself the right of punching <i>Leicester's</i> head
at the first convenient opportunity, very artistically conveyed.
Part most carefully thought out. The Revels cut short by the inconsiderate
appearance of <i>Amy Robsart</i> when they were just beginning,
which must have been annoying for the Lady of the Lake, who had
just arrived to pay homage to the Queen, and found herself obliged
to get upon her floating island again, and go home in the most
ignominious manner, without waiting even for the "shower of stars,"
which were to have fallen over the water. <i>Elizabeth</i>, however, seemed
quite unruffled by the interruption, perhaps thinking that anything
was a relief which put an end to the revels. <i>Finale</i> to this Act
dramatic, and well worked up. Third Act in two short <i>tableaux</i>,
concluding with a duel and explanation (in two lines) between
<i>Leicester</i> and <i>Tressilian</i>, after which the opera ends abruptly with
<i>Varney's</i> highly ungentlemanly practical joke upon poor <i>Amy
Robsart</i>, and <i>Leicester's</i> request to <i>Tressilian</i> to take his
sword
and run him through&mdash;which, however, he had no time to grant,
as the curtain fell at that moment. After that, well-deserved
floral tributes to Madame <span class="sc">Calvé</span>, and enthusiastic calls for singers,
composer, manager, and carriages.</p>

<p class="ind1"><i>First Voice.</i> Come follow, follow, follow, follow, follow, follow on!</p>

<p class="ind1"><i>Second Voice.</i> Why then should I follow, follow, follow, why then
must I follow, follow on?</p>

follow on!</p>

<h2>AT THE WORLD'S WATER SHOW.</h2>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent"><i>The performance has begun.</i></span> Captain <span class="sc">Boyton</span> <i>has just descended the
Chute in a boat, with a bevy of lightly-clad young ladies waving
flags with shrill enthusiasm. Canadians, Indians, and Negroes
row various craft containing Beauties of the Ballet about the
Lake. An elderly Negress stands on an island, and waves a towel
encouragingly at things in general. Two Clowns, accompanied by
a futile individual disguised as a Frog, start to run round the
margin of the Lake with a gallant determination to be funny, but
abandon the attempt after making a quarter of the distance, and
complete the circuit with a subdued and chastened demeanour.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Bravo</i> (<i>to</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Blazzey</span>, <i>enthusiastically</i>).
Capital show this&mdash;wonderfully
well arranged!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Blazzey</i> (<i>screwing up his eyes</i>). Y&mdash;yes. Better if they'd
had <i>water</i> running down the incline, though, and sent <i>all</i> the boats
in
that way.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bravo.</i> Don't see how they could pump up water enough for
that, myself; and if they did, it would all run through at the sides!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Blazz.</i> (<i>ignoring any hydraulic difficulties</i>). Oh, they could
have dodged that if they chose; anyway, that's how it <i>ought</i> to
have been managed!</p>

<p><i>Miss Frivell</i> (<i>to Mr. Hoplight</i>). I can hardly believe this is the
same place where <span class="sc">Buffalo Bill</span>
gave his performance only last
year, can you? It all looks so
different!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/040-800.png"><img src="images/040a-500.png" width="500" height="448" alt="'I find no difficulty in recognising it, myself.'" /></a>
<h5>"I find no difficulty in recognising it, myself."</h5></div>

<p><i>Mr. Hopl.</i> (<i>after ponderous
consideration.</i>) I find no difficulty
in recognising it, myself. The
difference you observe is due to
the fact that the arena which was
originally constructed for&mdash;er&mdash;displays
of horsemanship requires
to undergo some considerable&mdash;er&mdash;structural
alterations before
being equally well adapted to a
performance in which&mdash;er&mdash;boating
and swimming form the&mdash;er&mdash;principal
features.</p>

<p><i>Miss Friv.</i> (<i>with exemplary
gravity</i>). I see. You mean there
must be <i>water</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hopl.</i> Water is undoubtedly
an&mdash;er&mdash;indispensable
element in such an exhibition.</p>

<p><i>Miss Friv.</i> How clever of you
to know that! But perhaps
someone told you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hopl.</i> (<i>modestly</i>). I arrived
at it by the&mdash;er&mdash;light of my own
unassisted intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Miss Friv.</i> Did you? Not
<i>really</i>! "How far that little
candle throws his beams!" (<i>To herself.</i>) I didn't mean to be so
rude as that! But he's no business to be such a bore!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bravo</i> (<i>after the Sculling-race between</i> <span class="sc">Ross</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="sc">Bubear</span>).
That was a good race, eh? They're the champion scullers, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Blazz.</i> Don't see the point of setting 'em to race <i>here</i>,
though. Rather like running the Derby in a riding-school!</p>

<p><i>A Sympathetic Lady</i> (<i>during the Swimming-race</i>). How well those
girls do swim! I suppose they go under first, and then come up
again. But how damp they must get, to be sure, doing that twice a
day! I daresay they never get their hair properly dry from one
week's end to another. I should think that must be so uncomfortable
for them, you know. However, they seem to be having plenty of
fun among themselves. I wish we could hear what they are saying;
but there's so much to look at, that one misses most of it!</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>A Pontoon is moved out into the centre</i></span> <i>of the Lake, and three
"Rocky Mountain Wonders" give an entertainment on board. The
first Wonder constructs the letter A with himself and two high
ladders, up which the other two run nimbly. They meet at the
top with mutual surprise, and a touch of resentment, as if each
had expected at least to find solitude there. The Second Wonder
lies down on his back resignedly, and the Third, meanly availing
himself of the opportunity, stands on his friend's stomach, and
strikes an attitude. Both descend and bow, in recognition of
applause, and then each starts up his ladder again&mdash;only to meet
once more at the top, more surprised and annoyed than ever.
The Third Wonder refuses to be appeased unless he is allowed to
hold the Second head downwards by the ankles. After further
amenities of this kind they come down, apparently reconciled,
and are towed back to the shore.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Friv.</i> Is that supposed to be an illustration of life on the
Rocky Mountains?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hopl.</i> (<i>bringing the full powers of his mind to bear on the
subject</i>). I should be inclined to doubt myself whether it afforded any
accurate idea of either the industry or the&mdash;er&mdash;relaxations peculiar
to that region, which can hardly be favourable to such pursuits.</p>

<p><i>Miss Friv.</i> They might find it useful for escaping from a grizzly,
mightn't they?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hopl.</i> Hardly, if, as I have always been given to understand,
the grizzly bear is an equally expert climber. I imagine their title
of "Rocky Mountain Wonders" is merely indicative of their&mdash;er&mdash;origin,
and that their performances would indeed excite more
wonder in their native country than anywhere else. One should
always guard against taking these things in too literal a spirit.</p>

<h4>(<i>Adapted to the Requirements of the Army.</i>)</h4>

<p>"There was no doubt about it," queried
the Quartermaster to the Adjutant, "the
Chief certainly desired me to execute him?"</p>

<p>"That is unquestionably my impression,"
replied the Adjutant.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it never does to question his
orders," continued the Quartermaster; "it
makes him so wild if he fancies that you
are disobeying his commands."</p>

<p>"Quite so," admitted the Adjutant; "and
so the best thing is to carry them out. As
you know, obedience is 'the first law of a
soldier.'"</p>

<p>"Still, to shoot a man for nothing, does
seem a <i>little</i> hard."</p>

<p>"How do we know it's for nothing? You
may be sure the Chief has his own reasons
for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'everthing'">everything</ins>."</p>

<p>And so the two warriors walked to the
barrack square and sent for the unfortunate
Private <span class="sc">Thomas Atkins</span>. As the order was
conveyed to the quarters of the rank and file,
men lounged out of the mess-room, and discussed
the Colonel's orders. It seemed "a
bit strange," but it was not for them to
dispute the chief's command. And, as they
spoke, Private <span class="sc">Thomas Atkins</span> was produced.
He had a clean defaulter's sheet.</p>

<p>"On my word, I really trust that there
may be some mistake," said a Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel
M.D. "But, as I
am not now attached to the battalion, I have
no right to interfere."</p>

<p>Private <span class="sc">Thomas Atkins</span> was marched to a
wall, ordered to right-about turn, and then
(under the command of the Quartermaster)
shot.</p>

<p>Then the civil power, in the person of a
police-constable, thought it time to interfere,
and arrested the officer immediately in command.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the Colonel, subsequently;
"how exceedingly absurd! I
wanted the Quartermaster to give him a new
suit, and he thought I asked him to shoot
him! You fellows really ought to be more
careful!"</p>

<p>But nothing could be done, because the
matter had passed into the hands of the civil
power.</p>

<p>And, all things taken into consideration, it
was just as well that they had.</p>

<h2>THE PROPRIETORS' VADE MECUM.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Supplement for the Newspaper Press.</i>)</h4>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> What is the duty of a Newspaper Proprietor?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> To use his periodical for the benefit of the public by obtaining and affording information.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is he expected to expose abuses?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly, or he would be thought to be degrading the noble profession to which he has the honour to belong.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What is the customary result of an <i>exposé</i>?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> An action for libel.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> By whom is it frequently brought?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> By a man of straw.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And what is the alleged
libel?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That the plaintiff was described as being manufactured of no more substantial material.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> If a man is made of straw, how can he obtain assistance from a solicitor?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> By approaching a member of the junior branch of the legal profession who possesses no rooted objection to speculation.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What is a speculative
action?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> It is an action brought
to give a solicitor a chance of
getting costs.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is the length of trial a
matter of importance to the
plaintiff?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly not, because
he stands to win one way and
not to lose on the other.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What does a long trial
mean to the defendant?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Solicitor's fees by the
score and "refreshers" by the
dozen.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What is the outcome of
the proceedings?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> After many days, a verdict.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> In whose favour?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> The defendant's.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Does the defendant
benefit in consequence?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not at all&mdash;the reverse.
For after the finding of the
jury, he is at liberty to pay his
own costs.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why does he pay his
own costs?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because his statement
that the plaintiff is and was a
man of straw is practically
corroborated.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But does not the <i>exposé</i>
prove that he has done an
action well-deserving of his
country?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly; but this consideration
does not give him
unmixed satisfaction.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why does it not give
him unmixed satisfaction?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because, although losing
a huge sum of money may be
patriotic and large-minded, it
is scarcely business-like.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Are not newspapers intended
to benefit the public?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Unquestionably, but in
that public the individuality
of the proprietor should not be
entirely overlooked.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then what would you
recommend?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That instead of being
regarded as prey, newspapers
should be made to pay.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And how can that be
carried out?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> By making a law calling
upon a would-be plaintiff, in a
questionable action for libel, to
give security for costs.</li>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 17.</i>&mdash;"<i>Et tu, Bowlsey!</i>" said
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, a tear glistening on his long eyelashes. Of course he
should have said "<i>Brute</i>," but that is not Member for King's Lynn's
name. Remark followed upon incident that ruffled unusually dull
evening. <span class="sc">Tommy</span> was making one of his rare speeches; instructing
Chief Secretary on intricate point in Home-Rule Bill; complaining
of an omission in Amendment under discussion. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>,
turning round, explained to him the bearing of things. Audacious,
it is true. "The attempt," as <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span> said, "to instruct
your grandmother in the art of imbibing light but nutritious refreshment
a slight thing compared with the temerity of teaching Tommy
anything." When he detected <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> in attempt, he for
moment fixed him with surprised stare. Enough in ordinary circumstances
to paralyse a rhinoceros. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, who from precarious
retreat in a tree-top in Central Africa has watched the noon
slumbers of a horde of thirty lions, did not flinch. Then through
the startled House rang <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> withering rebuke: "Pray hold
your tongue!" an injunction which drew from <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> the
pained remark quoted above.</p>

<p>Coming from such a source it was doubly painful. Always understood
that <span class="sc">Tommy</span> founded his Parliamentary style upon <span class="sc">Grandolph's</span>
earlier manner. Whispered that Member for King's Lynn
had dreamed a dream of a new Fourth Party. He of course would
play the part of <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>; <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> (selected chiefly on
account
of his height and slimness of his figure) would stand for Arthur
Balfour before he came into his Princedom. The glories of Gorst
would live again in <span class="sc">Bartley</span>; and <span class="sc">Tommy</span> had spent sleepless
night in doubt as to whether he should enlist <span class="sc">Parker Smith</span> or
<span class="sc">Ambrose</span> in place of <span class="sc">Wolffy</span>, who now, in distant Madrid, wears
a
sombrero, drapes his <i>svelte</i> figure in a cloak, and interlards his
conversation
with cries of "<i>Carramba!</i>"</p>

<p>This point was decided by curious incident. One afternoon <span class="sc">Tommy</span>
came upon <span class="sc">Parker Smith</span> conversing with <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>.</p>

<p>"Don't you think <span class="sc">Parker Smith's</span> getting something of a bore?"
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> asked, when that eminent statesman moved away.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/047-1500.png"><img src="images/047a-600.png" width="600" height="440" alt="ANGELS IN 'THE HOUSE.'" /></a>
<h3 class="sans">"ANGELS IN 'THE HOUSE.'"</h3></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>

<p>"Now that's very odd indeed," said <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>. "Just as you
came up <span class="sc">Parker Smith</span> said to me 'Here comes <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>;
good fellow; means well; but don't you think he's making himself
something of a bore?'"</p>

<p>So <span class="sc">Parker Smith</span> lost his chance, and perhaps will never know
how or why. Thinking of these things 'tis quaint to find <span class="sc">Tommy</span>
turning and biting the hand which, so to speak, held for him the
Parliamentary bottle. "<i>Et tu, Bowlsey!</i>" <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> sighed
again, thinking of the days that are no more. "But I ought to
have remembered that he who plays at <span class="sc">Bowles</span> must expect rubbers."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tommy</span> declines to make room for his Uncle
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span>; even rudely repulses avuncular advances.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Sexton</span> magnanimously
relieved Mr. G., <span class="sc">John
Morley</span>, and, by implication,
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> and other
Members, from embarrassing
imputation. Sometimes, when
gentlemen in <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span>
suite have nothing nastier to
say, they sketch lurid pictures
of Mr. G. and the rest drawn
at wheels of <span class="sc">Sexton's</span> chariot.
All very well, they say, to talk
of Cabinet Meetings, and statesmanship
at Irish Office. The
real boss, as <span class="sc">Tim</span> would put it,
the arbiter of situation, is <span class="sc">Sexton</span>.
When these things are
said, <span class="sc">John Morley</span> smiles
grimly; Mr. G. pretends not to
hear; <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>
audibly raps fingers on his
manly breast; Liberals cheer
ironically; <span class="sc">Sexton</span> blushes, and
looks across to see if <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>
is listening.</p>

<p>To-night he feels this thing
has gone far enough. There
may, perhaps, be some smattering
of truth in it; but its disclosure cannot be pleasant to his
right hon. friends on Treasury Bench. Accordingly <span class="sc">Sexton</span> rose,
and, taking Mr. G. by the hand, as it were, and giving a finger to
<span class="sc">John Morley</span>, declared that there was no foundation for the imputation.
It was true he had from time to time offered suggestions,
the appositeness and value of which it was not for him to determine.
Occasionally they might have been accepted by the Government.
That was due not to the pressure of dictation, but to the force of
reason. Mr. <span class="sc">Morley</span> was a statesman not unacquainted with affairs,
whilst Mr. G. had reached an age at which he might be trusted with
some share in the conduct of a Bill. He could assure the House that
he was not, in this matter, dictator. Such a charge was, he added,
in burst of uncompromising self-abnegation, "imbecile."</p>

<p>"And they say," cried <span class="sc">Webster</span>, for him unusually mixed,
"that Irishmen have no sense of humour."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Sexton</span> generously puts Mr. G. right in eyes of
Universe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/048-800.png"><img src="images/048a-560.png" width="560" height="442" alt="'He declared that there was no foundation for the imputation.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"He declared that there was no foundation for the imputation."</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;Been remarked of late, in quarter behind
Front Opposition Bench, that <span class="sc">Theobald</span> has appeared preternaturally
preoccupied. Thought he was brooding over the drought,
or the prospects of Home Rule. Secret out to-night. Been concocting
a joke; taken him some time; but, then, consider the quality. Some
weeks ago order issued in Ireland prohibiting hoisting of flags on
hotels, and other private buildings. <span class="sc">Theobald</span> diligently concentrating
his thoughts upon this fresh iniquity, gradually worked out
his joke. Appeared on paper to-night in shape of question addressed
to <span class="sc">John Morley</span>. Supposing (so it runs) <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span> should
visit
Ireland, and stay in an hotel, would the Government take measures
to legalise the hoisting of the Royal Standard on the building?</p>

<p>Delightful to watch <span class="sc">Theobald</span> when he had fired this bolt;
fixed his eye attentively on Mr. G., to see how he took it, the paper
in his hand trembling with excitement. Didn't often make a
joke; doesn't remember a former occasion. Work somewhat
exhausting, especially in hot weather; but when he did take his
coat off and set to it must be admitted he turned out a rare article.
All very well for <span class="sc">John Morley</span> to affect to make light of the
business. Not very probable that when the <span class="sc">Queen</span> visited Ireland
she would put up at an hotel; a hypothetical question; deal with the
question when it arises, and all the rest of Ministerial commonplaces.
<span class="sc">Theobald's</span> shaft had gone home, and when he saw Mr. G.
wince, and <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> grow pale, he felt that the continuous
labour of nights and days was rewarded.</p>

<p>"Didn't think I could do it," he said when I warmly congratulated
him. "Not used to that sort of thing, you know. Never know
what you can do till you try. A little hard at first. The thing is
to keep pegging away. Still, I'm glad it's over. Shan't try
another this year. Shall go away now for a bit of a holiday to
recruit."</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Not heard much lately of <span class="sc">Henniker-Heaton</span>. Compared
with what my dear old friend <span class="sc">Raikes</span> used to suffer from this
quarter, <span class="sc">Arnold Morley's</span> withers are unwrung. "You've not
given up the crusade, have you?" I asked <span class="sc">Henniker</span>, meeting him
in the Lobby just now.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I do not mean to rest till not only I get Ocean
Penny Postage, but have introduced at home a smaller but much-needed
reform. Custom here at Christmas is, as I daresay you
know, to give postman present.
That I hold to be a criminal
reversal of natural course of
events. It's the Post-Office
should give its customers a
Christmas-box, as in some
places doth the grocer and eke
the milkman. This tax upon
the general public on behalf of
a department of the State is
another evidence of the grasping
disposition of St. Martin's-le-Grand.
I'll be up and at 'em
again soon. Fact is, of late
I've had my own troubles.
Have mentioned them in letter
to <i>Times</i>, so don't mind talking
to you on a subject that has
brought me from unknown
admirers many expressions of
sympathy, the comfort of which
has, it is true, been somewhat
lessened by the fact that postage
was unpaid. It's this
Australian Bank business. You
know the proud motto of that
great Colony beyond the Sea,
'Advance, Australia!' Well,
having lived there sometime, I thought it only polite to fall in
with the suggestion. I advanced Australia a good deal of money
in the way of purchase of bank stock, which has melted away like
snow on the river. <span class="sc">Curran's</span> in the same box: but we shall get
over this, and you may bet a shilling postage-stamp to a halfpenny
newspaper-cover we'll Advance Australia no more."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
